**RESEARCH + BACKGROUND INFO**

Not only does California have the largest death row in the country with more than 700 condemned prisoners awaiting execution, but it also has the largest death row in the entire Western Hemisphere. Throughout the state's history, roughly 740 people have been executed. In the last twenty years, California's death row population has grown by 28 percent.

Thirteen people have been executed in California in the last 45 years, and five have been freed after being proved innocent.

Defendants can be sentenced to death for a felony in which they were not responsible for the murder. Life without parole is presently legal in California as an alternative to capital punishment.

Ballot Proposition 34 (2012), which sought to repeal the death penalty and replace it with life in prison, failed, yet it received 48 percent support from voters. Four years later, Proposition 62, which would have replaced the death penalty with a stricter version of life in prison, also failed, but it received 46.8 percent support from voters.

On March 13, 2019, California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order halting the death penalty within the state. Governor Newsom also called for the immediate closure of the execution chamber at San Quentin State Prison and a repeal of California's lethal injection protocol.
